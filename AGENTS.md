# AGENTS.md — working in this repository

animal-island-ui is a React 18 + TypeScript 5.7 component library (40 components, Less
Modules, Vite 7 library build, Vitest 4) inspired by a cozy island-style UI.
One runtime dependency: `naive-icons` (the icon set); everything else is a peerDependency
or devDependency. MIT License.

This file is the entry point for coding agents. It routes; the referenced docs hold the
detail. Keep it lean — add new rules to the docs below, not here.

## Read first, by task

Conflict priority (high → low): repository source code (`*.tsx` / `*.module.less` /
`*.config.ts`) → this file → docs. When docs disagree with source, source wins — fix the
doc in the same change.

## Verification

```bash
npm run ci      # format:check + check:docs + lint + test:run + test:a11y + build — must pass before any PR
npm run badges  # after coverage/component-count changes: regenerates badges in README.md + docs/README.zh-CN.md
```

A pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) runs `npm run ci`; don't bypass it with
`--no-verify`.

## Content that must be kept in sync

Documentation is a first-class deliverable here. There are exactly two kinds of
intentional duplication — when you touch one side, update the other in the same change:

1. **Translations** (mirror structure and meaning; tech terms stay English):
    - `docs/**` (English) ↔ `docs/zh-CN/**`
    - `README.md` ↔ `docs/README.zh-CN.md`
    - `skills/animal-island-ui-style/SKILL.md` ↔ `SKILL.zh-CN.md` (human-review copy; agents read only SKILL.md)
2. **The published skill restates usage** of what the design system defines:
    - component API changes → `skills/animal-island-ui-style/references/components/<category>.md` (props verbatim from source)
    - component style changes → `docs/design-system/components/<category>.md` (+ zh-CN mirror)

Everything else is single-source: the design system ([docs/design-system/](docs/design-system/README.md))
defines the design language and depends on nothing; code implements it; all other docs
link instead of restating. The skill directory is self-contained — links between files
inside the skill stay relative (they must resolve after the skill is installed on its
own), while anything outside the skill directory is referenced only by GitHub URL, never
by repo-relative path.

`npm run check:docs` enforces: every component in `src/components/` is covered in both
`docs/design-system/components/` and the skill's `references/components/` (which are also
capped at 200 lines per file), and `docs/zh-CN/` mirrors `docs/`. Demo pages have **no**
automated check — a new component must be registered in three places by hand:
`demo/pageInfo.ts`, `demo/ComponentPage.tsx` (`PAGE_INFO` + `PAGES`), and
`demo/HomePage.tsx` (`components` list). If a demo menu click shows a blank main area,
check `ComponentPage.tsx`'s internal `PAGE_INFO` first.

## Comments

Comments here are read by agents first. An agent can already read the code; it
cannot run the experiment that exposed the bug, and it does not have the commit
history. So the bar is narrow: **write a comment only for what cannot be
recovered by reading the file.** Anything inferable from the code is noise to an
agent too — restating it costs tokens and buries the few lines that matter.

When something is worth writing, say _why this way and not that way_, and prefer
an invariant over the current numbers so the comment survives the next rewrite.

**Add one when**

- the wrong version compiles and passes tests but misbehaves at runtime —
  `if (event.button === 0)` looks redundant until you learn React's
  `onMouseDown` fires for every button, so dropping the guard lets a right-drag
  create an event
- the reason came from a measurement, not from reading the code — a `Dayjs`
  object is a fresh reference every render, so putting it in a `useMemo` dep
  array never hits the memo; nothing in review reveals this
- it is a public contract the signature does not imply — `events` is memoised by
  array reference, so mutating `start` / `end` in place changes nothing
- two files must agree and nothing enforces it — a TS constant and its LESS twin

**Do not comment**

- what the code plainly does, or the statement above it
- a rationale already given by a sibling comment in the same file — one
  explanation per fact, not one per occurrence
- history (`changed from … to …` is what `git blame` is for)
- a fixed bug, once the trap it guarded against is gone
- arithmetic the next line already shows

**Keep comments true across edits — this is the part that rots.** Name or derive
values from their constant instead of copying them. **Whenever you edit code,
re-read the comments sitting directly above it**: they outlive the edit that
introduced them and are the first thing to go stale and mislead.

In tests, comment the premise — why this setup is the failing case, what a magic
date is — never the assertion.

Keep comment density near the repo norm (~9% median across `src/components/`);
if a file you touched is noticeably denser, most of what was added is restatement.

## Ground rules

- Never invent component APIs — read the source or declarations first.
- Visual changes must satisfy [docs/design-system/design-rules.md](docs/design-system/design-rules.md).
- Keep runtime dependencies to a minimum — the only one is `naive-icons`
  (rationale in [docs/adr/](docs/adr/README.md)); never disable `preserveModules` / `cssCodeSplit`.
- Conventional Commits; branch from `main`.
- Docs are English-primary with Chinese mirrors under `docs/zh-CN/`.
- For audit/optimization requests: report P0 (must-fix) vs suggestions and let the user
  decide — don't apply every suggestion unprompted.
